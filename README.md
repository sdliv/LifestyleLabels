# LifestyleLabels
Lifestyle Labels is a demo application I built for internal sales use at Emarsys.  This repo contains NO CODE.

It features some GIFs of the functionality I built at Emarsys for their iOS SDK.  The demo application features predict
functionality, recommending products based on previously view products.  It also features smart push notifications based
based on user behavior.  The recording of the .GIFs does not reflect the performance of the app.  It is recorded at 8fps.
